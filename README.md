# Find the pair

***Find the pair*** is a single-player puzzle video game. The goal of the game is to find all the matching pairs in a board by unveiling cells one by one. When a pair is found, it uncovers both cells. Cells go back to their original hidden state when their content is not equal.

## Functionality

- As a user, I can click on any cell of the board to discover hidden pairs.
- As a user, I can see how much time is taking me to find all the pairs.
